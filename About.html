      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little about me... I am currently a second year
      student at the University of California, San Diego majoring in Computer Science. I 
      hail from the best of the six colleges within UCSD: obviously Warren College. On a 
      more personal level, I was born in Lynchburg, Virginia but raised and grew up right
      here in San Diego. I moved here when I was two years old, and I absolutely love it here. 
      I consider myself a Southern California native. Obviously West coast best coast. I live 
      about ten minutes from UCSD, which is extremely convenient for me.

    <div id = "mainText2">
      I first started learning Computer Science during a summer camp that my mother signed 
      me up for between freshman year and sophmore year of high school. Funnily enough, it was
      a camp on HTML/CSS. Since then, I've self studied HTML/CSS a bit more in order to create 
      this site. Hopefully my skills have improved. From camp, I was next exposed to Computer Science
      my junior year of high school, when I enrolled in AP Computer Science. That was when my love 
      for coding took off. I will freely admit that I struggled in the 
    </div>

    <div id = "mainText3">
     class, but it was a satisfyingkind of struggle. It was a struggle with validation, as every instance where my code ran felt
     like sweet, sweet victory. I've never looked back or questioned my decision to enter the field 
     since. Feel free to peruse the site and shoot me an email if you have any questions or comments
     about the site, my projects, anything. Also feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! I'm always 
     looking for more connections!.
