This is my personal website using HTML/CSS skills 
that I have been learning on my own, just based on 
what I can glean from the internet. In the future,
I would like to expand this website by integrating
responsive features by learning JavaScript. The 
current JavaScript that I do have in my index.html
was knowingly pulled from online and will be credited
as such. It was used to enable simple scrolling with
my navigation bar. Thanks for checking my site out!
